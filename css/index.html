		<h2>Katara's friends</h2>
		<p>Every member of the Avatar Gang has a crucial task on their mission. Aang, the Avatar, has to train so that he can reach his full potential. Katara keeps everyone on track. Without her, the rest of the gang would surely goof off. Sokka may be the comedic relief of the group, but he is so much more. He has a warm heart and he knows just how to cheer everyone up. Toph is the muscle of the group. She teaches Aang to stop being so soft. CLick on the links below to learn more about them:</p>
